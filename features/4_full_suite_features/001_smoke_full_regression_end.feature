  And I have a valid "Schedule" data in Xml with the following:

    | Confidentiality   | *hidden      |
    | Smoke_Screen_Flag | false       |
  And I have a valid "Commissions" data in Xml with the following:
    | UID                     | CBIC309Y/01         |
    | Core_Number             | CBIC309Y            |

    | Confidentiality         | hidden              |

  And I have a valid "Programmes" data in Xml with the following:
    | Core_Number             | CBIC309Y           |
    | UID                     | CBIC309Y/01        |
    | Version_Number          | 01                 |
    | Gross_Duration          | 1800               |

    | Confidentiality         | hidden             |
    | Repository_Confidential | false              |
  And I copy "Schedule" & "Commissions" & "Programmes" file to folder "location"
  And I set the system time to "-10" days in order to trigger transfer
  When I create a workflow to trigger a transfer to Destination "Playout"
  Then I should receive a notification that the transfer has completed
