Feature: Programmes data imported into Mediaflex

  Background:
    Given I have a valid "Commissions" data in Xml with the following:
      | UID                     | CBIC311Y/01         |
      | Core_Number             | CBIC311Y            |
      | Version_Number          | 01                  |
      | Video_Source            | FD                  |
      | Delivery_Date           | +90                 |
      | Topicality              | non_topical         |
      | Supplier_Type           | In-House            |
      | Genre                   | Childrens NHU       |
      | In-House_Dept           | ANCâ€“CURRENT AFFAIRS |
      | Confidentiality         | hidden              |
      | Repository_Confidential | false               |
    And I copy "Commissions" file to folder "\\\\fgbw1e2efs002\\metadata\\ingest\\commissions"

  Scenario:  As an MST user, after Programmes data has been imported into Mediaflex, I should Verify ALL data populated
    Given I have a valid "Programmes" data in Xml with the following:
      | Core_Number             | CBIC311Y           |
      | UID                     | CBIC311Y/01        |

      | Confidentiality         | hidden             |
      | Repository_Confidential | false              |
    And I copy "Programmes" file to folder "\\\\fgbw1e2efs002\\metadata\\ingest\\programmes"
#    Given I log into Mediaflex
#    When I search for UID "CBIC311Y/01"
#    Then I should see result "1" returned in Mediaflex
#    And I verify Version_Number as "01"

  Scenario:  As an MST user, after Programmes data has been imported into Mediaflex, I should Verify mixed values are updated on existing Programmes data
    Given I send an update "Programmes" data in Xml with the following:
